  <h1 class="uxtitle">Case Studies</h1>

  <h2 class="uxtitle2">Retro Vibe Case Study</h2>

  <p class="uxparagraph">Retro Vibe is a video game mobile application that I created as part of my user experience course at Udacity. I designed this project from the creation to final design with research, analysis, UX and UI design principals, test validation, usability, and feedback.  </p>

  <p class="uxparagraph"> <strong>Duration:</strong> 9 Weeks</p>

  <p class="uxparagraph"> <strong>Tools Used:</strong>  Figma, WebAim, Google Gallery, Zeplin, Miro, Lookout</p>

  <p class="uxparagraph"> <strong>Methods:</strong>  Research, Surveys, Interviews, Sketches, Usability Study, Prototypes, and Wireframes  </p>

  <h2 class="uxtitle2">Challenge/Problem</h2>

  <p class="uxparagraph">Our app was well received by the participants who tested out the app, but they did have some suggestions on the functionality and placement of some of the sections on the app. After correcting the functionality problems which were correcting the destination of the back and home buttons on the details screen.  I came to the conclusion that the app needed to be simplified in design and scaled down as to not clutter the pages with too many buttons/options. </p>


  <h2 class="uxtitle2">Research and Analysis</h2>

  <p class="uxparagraph">After the interview process I came to the conclusion that people in the 30 and up age range dont have much time to play video games but there were aspects to the app we could expand on to meet customers needs.

    The ideation phase consisted of coming up with ideas to expand features on the app, and during the prioritization phase I decided that adding a “most popular”, “Auction”,  and “community” sections but as a future update.

  </div>


    <h2 class="uxtitle2">Design Concepts</h2>

    <p class="uxparagraph">The design process went through a few phases in the beginning but were small. the initial design was about 8 screens with a sign-in and login screens. The main and item pages were simple with alot of category buttons in the middle of the screen. there were also sketches of a blog, livestream and  group pages that could be added in the future. </p>

  </div>

    <h2 class="uxtitle2">Prototyping</h2>

    <p class="uxparagraph">Here are the low, mid, and high fidelity Prototypes of the Retro Vibe app. the Layout is simple with the prototype being the main parts of the app, just testing out the functionality and layout.</p>

  <div class="flex-container">
    <div><img class="uxpics" src="images/lofi1.png" alt="low fi prototype screen 1"></div>
    <div><img class="uxpics" src="images/midfi1.png" alt="Mid fi prototype screen 1"></div>
    <div><img class="uxpics" src="images/hifi1.png" alt="Hi Fi prototype screen 1"></div>
  </div>

    <h2 class="uxtitle2">Test: Validation, Usability, Feedback</h2>

    <p class="uxparagraph">Once the prototype was completed they were tested by 5 participants and went very well. Most of the feedback was positive with only a few s
      uggestions. Some participants did get confused on the login and sign-up pages, so the decision was made to remove those 3 pages. 
       to add to the details page to help accommodate the customer when purchasing their product.  For example moving the back button up top on the navigation instead of the bottom of the screen and adding a favorites button to save an item.
      </p>

      <h2 class="uxtitle2">Design: Iteration</h2>

      <p class="uxparagraph">After the low-fi and  mid-fi prototypes were tested the only changes made were  the categories section. The high-fi redesigns had the most changes after the third round of testing. participants said the app looked good but had a few suggestions for accessibility reasons and customer shopping needs. Adding a favorites button on the details page, color scheme change to the entire app, and adding a additional lower nav bar for buttons on the first 2 screens. Also added the categories section back to the main screen and redesigned the buttons on that page also.</p>

     <div><img class="uxpics" src="images/midfi2.png" alt="Mid fi prototype screen 2"></div>
      <div><img class="uxpics" src="images/midfi3.png" alt="Mid fi prototype screen 3"></div>
    </div>

      <h2 class="uxtitle2">Solution & Impact Overview</h2>

      <p class="uxparagraph">My final solution for the app ended up being to add more details/options on the details screen and have the same button styles across all screens. overall i did learn a lot while working on this project. the biggest lesson was that even if I was familiar with the industry I was building the app for, I should have done more extensive research on the subject to better accommodate the companies needs and to streamline the design process all together. I still do plan on designing the additional 3 pages of the app and believe that with those pages it would create a better experience for the customers visiting the app.</p>
