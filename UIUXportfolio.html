    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>This User Experience project is called Retro VIbe, a ecommerce video game based app that allows customers to buy, sell and trade classic video games with each other and retailers (pawn shops, online stores, etc) on different platforms that aren't easily found in stores anymore. I created this as part of my user experience course at Udacity. I designed, created tests, and from start to finish using research, analysis, UX and UI design principles, test validation, usability, and feedback from participants.

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>Context</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>Retro Vibe is a ecommerce videogame app that I developed for my user experience nanodegree from Udacity. The goal of this project was to learn the fundamentals of user experience and to apply app design research, conduct in-depth interviews, prototyping, and data analysis to create a  UX case study.

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>Research Plan</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2"> <p>Research started with deciding on what gaming platform to focus on to simplify the process. I chose the Playstation 2 because it was the best selling video game console ever and had a wide variety of games that are great and people still play, and it had most of my favorite games also. Then I looked at some ecommerce apps that sold a variety of different items (technology, clothes, etc) to get an idea of what the design of the app should look like.</p>

      <strong>Screening Questions</strong>
      
      <p>Then To get a better idea of what else should be on the app I created some screening questions to ask some of my friends and family that played video games what types of games/systems they wanted to see on the app to increase their chances of using it. (link to PDF of screening questions)
      </p>

        <strong>Script sent to Participants</strong>
      
      <p>After the screening questions I also created some research questions for the participants to gauge their video game habits today as adults compared to years ago when we played games regularly.  ( link to PDF of Usability guide)
      </p>

        <strong>Research Report (revise)</strong>

      <p>And this is where I first ran into trouble with the project, the research report. As I was collecting the results of the research report I had a feeling that the data I gathered wouldnt directly be related to the app I was designing but this made it clear. I made the mistake of focusing on what I could add to make casual gamers more interested in using the app to buy retro games instead of catering to collectors. I had to go back and do more research on what collectors would look for if they used an app like this. I looked at some research papers and youtube videos on the habits of collectors in general and also video game collectors to get a clearer picture of what to design.For the initial sketch I still used the e-commerce references I found to sketch out the first design since it was just structure and no specific information was needed yet.

    -Interview notes and Synthesis: after analyzing the results gatherers from the participants, the data was grouped into 4 categories
    digital copies of games are popular than physical
    sell games online but not frequently
    have never sold any items online
    doesn't collect classic games at all</p>

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>feature Ideation</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>
      For feature Ideation I came up with new ideas to possibly add to the app in the future. Then for Feature Prioritization I  created a chart and picked 3 ideas that would make the app better that was not too difficult to build onto the app. Those ideas were:
being able to sell other  game related items online: because this would expand the use of the site and will drive more traffic because of the wider audience.
having the ability to trade items with other collectors: because this  gives customers another option to obtain items easier and rare items that are hard to find
Having the ability to auction off items: because this gives customers a chance to bid live on items from other customers fast and possibly at a lower price.</p>

    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>
      The first prototype using Figma which included a sign-up/sign-in page, main page, Item page, and item detail page. I found a few participants to test the prototype out and the results surprised me. I found that out of the 5 people who tested it all seemed to have trouble and got confused with the sign-in/sign-up screens, but the rest of the app functioned great. That was a good indicator to remove those pages for now since it could be easily added in later and focus on the main pages where the content mattered. Other minor changes made were naming the pages and making sure the back button worked correctly on each page.

  <div class="grid-item-2"><p>
    After the low-fi and  mid-fi prototypes were tested the only changes made were  the categories section. The high-fi redesigns had the most changes after the third round of testing. participants said the app looked good but had a few suggestions for accessibility reasons and customer shopping needs.

    <div class="grid-item-2">
      <p class="finalpara">The accessibility changes that were made to the app were adding a favorites button on the details page, color scheme change to the entire app, and adding a additional lower nav bar for buttons on the first 2 screens. Also added the categories section back to the main screen and redesigned the buttons on that page also.</p>

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>Final Product</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2">
      <p class="finalpara">My final solution for the app ended up being to add more details/options on the details screen and have the same button styles across all screens. overall i did learn a lot while working on this project. the biggest lesson was that even if I was familiar with the industry I was building the app for, I should have done more extensive research on the subject to better accommodate the companies needs and to streamline the design process all together. I still do plan on designing the additional 3 pages of the app and believe that with those pages it would create a better experience for the customers visiting the app.
