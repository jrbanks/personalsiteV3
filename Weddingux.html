    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>This project was a redesign of a wedding announcement website for a friend's upcoming wedding. I got the idea after getting invited and looking at the site. It was a basic layout that I thought I could improve and turn into a mobile app. </p>

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>Research Plan</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2"> <p>The first thing I did was check out the origional website to see what content was there and how it was formatted to get an idea of how to convert it to mobile. i looked at the landing page(top of website) and below the picture where I could see the most common ways the site was formatted format the website had. </p>

  <div class="grid-item-2"> <p>Then went to Dribble.com to get inspiration from other wedding app designs to compare the type of content and palcement form each of the different platforms. Below you can see the apps i found </p></div>

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>Lo-Fi Prototype</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>I skipped the sketching portion of the design process since it was a redesign and coming form the website and already had a general idea of where I was going with the design. I created the Lo-fi  prototype by making a page for each section of the wedding site. I created a landing page and catagories page, then  recreated  the announcement/ information page, registry, picture album, and RSVP pages. i did make one major change to the layout of the picture page. I spread all the picturs out instead of having them in a carousel format so people can see every picture by scrolling down, then be able to click on it to enlarge it instead of having to scroll one by one through each. </p>

    <div class="grid-item-1"><h2>Hi-Fi Prototype and accessibility</h2></div>
    <div class="grid-item-2"><p>For the hi fi prototype I copied all the text from the website and added in pictures for the catagories on page 2 and registry page. I kept a white background and used the WebAIM: Contrast Checker to make sure the gold color on the site was ok for accessiblity purposes. Turns out the color had to be slightly adjusted darker. (The landing page background picture is lighter on actual prototype) </p>
